## Merb-auth gems

[merb-auth][] is a meta-gem.
A meta-gem is a Ruby gem without any code.
Its sole purpose is to declare dependencies and make installation easier.

As of Merb 1.0.x, merb-auth uses three gems:

* [merb-auth-core][]
* [merb-auth-more][]
* [merb-auth-slice-password][]

### merb-auth-core

[merb-auth-core][] does not try to dictate what you should use as a user model,
or how it should authenticate.
Instead, it focuses on the logic required
to check that an object passes authentication
and to store the keys of authenticated objects in the session.

This is, in fact, the guiding principle of MerbAuth.
The Session is used as the place for authentication,
with a sprinkling of controller helpers.

You can choose to protect a controller action, a route, or a group of routes.
This is why you might hear people refer to an authenticated session.

MerbAuth makes use of Merb’s exception handling facilities,
which return correct HTTP status codes.
To fail a login, or to force a login at any point in your controller code,
simply raise an ``Unauthenticated`` exception (with an optional message)
and the user will be presented with a login page.
The login page is, in fact,
the view template for ``Extensions#unauthenticated``.

It is possible to use MerbAuth with any object as a user object,
provided that the object does not evaluate to false
and it can be serialized in and out of the session.

Finally, merb-auth gains great power from its "chained strategies" capacity.
You can add as many strategies as you like;
they will be tried one after another until either one is found that works (login)
or none of them have passed (failed attempt).

An authentication strategy is just a way to authenticate a request.
Examples of strategies would be:

* Salted user (user login with a password using a "salted" encryption)
* OpenID
* API key/token
* Basic HTTP Authentication


### merb-auth-more

[merb-auth-more][] adds extra features to merb-auth-core.
The gem offers a series of generic Strategies and "User" object "mixins".

Strategies:

* login or email password form (aka password\_form)
* basic HTTP authentication (aka basic\_auth)
* OpenID

Mixins:

* ActiveRecord salted user
* DataMapper salted user
* relaxdb salted user
* sequel salted user

The salted user mixin provides basic salted SHA1 password authentication.
It implements the required ``User.authenticate method``
for use with the default password strategies.

### merb-auth-slice-password

[merb-auth-slice-password][] is a very simple Merb slice,
providing basic login and logout functionality,
form-based password logins, and basic authentication.

By default, the slice will load the ``password\_form``
and ``basic\_auth`` strategies.

Views and strategies can be customized,
as explained in the "Authenticated Hello World" example.


## Authentication in Merb Stack

When you generate an application with the default merb stack[^merb-stack-app],
merb-auth is already set up for normal usage.

If you don't want to use this,
simply comment out the dependency on ``merb-auth``
in ``config/dependencies.rb``.


## Authenticated Hello World


### Generate an application

The first step is to generate your application, using the Merb stack.

    $ merb-gen app hello_world
    $ cd hello_world
{:lang=shell html_use_syntax=true}

This generates an application stub, with authentication already configured.
The basic elements are:

    app/models/user.rb

    merb/merb-auth/setup.rb
    merb/merb-auth/strategies.rb
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

By default, the setup for user authentication is taken care of,
using a password and login.
Of course, we first need to set up the database and add a user.


    $ rake db:automigrate
    $ merb -i
    >> u = User.new(:login => "login_name")
    >> u.password = u.password_confirmation = "sekrit"
    >> u.save
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}


### Generate something to protect

Now that we have an application and a user, we need something to protect.

    $ merb-gen controller hello_world
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

Let's put something into the controller.

    class HelloWorld < Application
      def index
        "Hello World"
      end
    end
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

If you fire up merb now and look at <http://localhost:4000/hello_world>,
you'll see the "Hello World" results.

### Protect the route

It's not protected yet, so let's fix that.
We can either protect it using the routes in ``config/router.rb``
or in the controller action.
Let's try the router-based approach first.

Open up ``config/router.rb``:

    Merb::Router.prepare do
      authenticate do
        match("/hello_world").to(:controller => "hello_world")
      end
    end
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

This will cause the user to login.
This is discovered in the router and when it fails, it stops in the router. (???)
Try to hit <http://localhost:4000/hello_world> now.
You'll see that you need to log in to access it!

Ok.
Logout, using <http://localhost:4000/logout>.


### Protect the controller

Now let's remove the code from the router
and put the protection at the controller level.
This will allow a finer control over resources for example.


    Merb::Router.prepare do
      match("/hello_world").to(:controller => "hello_world")
    end
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

Let's now put it into the controller:

    class HelloWorld < Application

      before :ensure_authenticated

      def index
        "Hello World"
      end

    end
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}


To get access to the currently logged-in user inside your controller, use:

    session.user
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

Really...
For a basic Hello World authentication, that's it.


### Overwrite the default views

If you want more customization, you can do:


    rake slices:merb-auth-slice-password:freeze:views
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

What that will do is copy the views from the slice
to the ``slices`` directory in your application.

Then you need to move/copy them to your ``app/views`` directory
and edit the copied views.

    $ cp $ROOT/slices/merb-auth-slice-password/app/views/exceptions/unauthorized.html.erb \
      $ROOT/app/views/exceptions/
{:lang=shell html_use_syntax=true}


[^merb-stack-app]: merb-gen app hello\_world

## Testing an authenticated request

To test a request that needs to be authenticated, you will first need to login.
The easiest way to login when you are running a request spec is to use a helper.

Here is an example of two helpers added to ``spec/spec\_helper.rb``.

    Merb::Test.add_helpers do

      def create_default_user
        unless User.first(:login => "krusty")
          User.create( :login => "krusty",
                       :password => "klown",
                       :password_confirmation => "klown") or raise "can't create user"
        end
      end

      def login
        create_default_user
        request("/login", {
          :method => "PUT",
          :params => {
            :login => "krusty",
            :password => "klown"
          }
        })
      end

    end
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

The first helper creates a default user unless it already exists.
The second helper sends a login request using the default user's attributes.
Note that the login action uses the PUT HTTP verb.

Now that you added these helpers, you just need to slightly modify your examples:

    before(:each) do
      login
      @response = request(resource(:articles))
    end
{:lang=ruby html_use_syntax=true}

In the above example, the request sent to the articles URI will be authenticated.
